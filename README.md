# Fuzzy DNA Search
Ultra efficient tool for DNA patterns and traits searching using FM-Index. FM-Index is a genius data structures which is surely best of both worlds. It is space as well as time efficient. Considering these characterstics we put them to good use which was to compress DNA sequeunces and perform fast pattern queries in them. The transdisciplanry application is one of its kind. 

The web application is completely built on Flutter using Python Flask API as the backend.

Soon we will be hosting it. URL for that will be provided here.
